# Intermittent Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered with the Expo CLI. The problem is characterized by intermittent errors during the `expo start` or `expo prebuild` commands, often without a clear or helpful error message.  Standard debugging techniques, such as console logging and examining the Expo CLI output, proved insufficient in resolving this issue.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified representation of the project where the error was observed. The exact circumstances leading to the error were difficult to reproduce reliably.  

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution.  Note that this solution is contingent on the root cause being X, where X might be outdated dependencies, environment issues, or conflicts with other CLI tools. A full investigation would be needed to precisely identify the trigger.
